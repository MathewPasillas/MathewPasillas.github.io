    <br>

    <p>I was born on December 24, 1997 in the city of Fresno. Growing up, I was really shy but also a bad child. My mom said that when I was little, I would throw a lot of tantrums. I would either repeatedly bang my head on the floor or grab the closes object and throw it at the closest person. Thankfully I was able to grow out of it once I started first grade. I’ve been a really calm person ever since I grew out of that stage. I view myself as an individual that is funny, smart, caring, responsible, respectable, and open-minded. I’m a little curious about what others might think about my personality. Although in most of my pictures you may see me not wearing any glasses, but I’m actually suppose to wear glasses regularly due to my terrible eye sight.</p>
